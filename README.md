##### Game Description #####
-------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------
"When the world shattered, sound was the first thing to die."
--------------------------------------------------------------

Once, the Five Lands pulsed with life — connected by wind, trade, and magic. Then came the Shattering: a silent cataclysm that sundered the world into drifting islands suspended in the void. Cities froze mid-breath, birds fell still mid-flight. And in the space between — silence. Eternal, deafening silence.
You are the Wanderer, a lone soul who can still hear echoes of the past. With nothing but a sword and fading memories, you must traverse floating ruins, and uncover the truth behind the Silence.
But the lands are not truly dead. Whispers echo in the windless dark. Monsters stir. And silence… is never empty.
